# Open program
## Problem/opportunity
I have no experience with PHP and Laravel. During the open programme, I would like to learn more about these subjects. 
## Approach
To stay within the constraints of the AI semester, I'm going to create an AI application. Using [this library](https://php-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), you can make similar predictions as I have done before using Jupiter notebook. 
## Goal
At the end of the open programme, I will have a working PHP Laravel MVC application that allows you to make predictions.
